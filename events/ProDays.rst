Congratulations! You've invited to volunteer at this weekend's ProDay 
event!!! YAY! Your mission is to arrive at the CS Building to get the 
banner, stickers, tees, laptop, and tablecloth (with table clips) from 
the ACM office at 11:40! Then, you will need to go check-in at Havener 
in the atrium by the helpdesk. You will then be told our table number. 
Upon receiving our table number, you will report to that table and 
begin setting up (Be ready by noon!). You will both need to be 
present throughout the event. Do not to eat during this event, as we 
can be fined and potentially asked to leave. Do not discuss specifics
about the department during the event! The event will end around 
2:30-3:00 pm. We will also be fined if there is any trash left around 
our table, so refrain from leaving anything behind. 

tl;dr
Don't eat during the event
Do not leave early
Do not leave trash behind
Do not speak negatively about S&T or the Department
DO tell students about ACM
DO encourage students to get involved
DO put things back in the office in a nice/orderly manner

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best Wishes,
<Your Name>

Sample Dialog
---------
+ “Hi, ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery. We are the largest organization 
  for Computer Science on S&T Campus. We have multiple special interest groups in areas
  such as AI, Web Development, Security, Competition, Mentorship and Outreach, Data 
  Science, and Hack. Each special interest group usually meets once a week. We host 
  events such as the hackathon, Cyber Boot Camp, MegaMiner AI, and MinerLAN. If you’re 
  interested, please write your name and email on the sheet.“
+ Feel free to talk about any of the committees they seem interested in. Try asking the
  student what they're interested in or if they have an interest, if not, push them all!

General Tips
------------
1. Arrive in plenty of time to set up the table. Students will begin entering Havener at
   exactly noon.
2. The banner, tablecloth, table clips, stickers are all in the ACM drawer in the ACM office.
3. The tablecloth might not fit the table, don’t worry about it!
4. Lay out the ACM stickers and hand them out to potential new members.
5. Make sure the laptop works before you bring it to Havener!!

Future Ideas
------------
1. Create a video of clips from each committee and showcase it on on the laptop. 
2. Create a physical form
