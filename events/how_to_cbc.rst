How to Cyber Boot Camp

camp for S&T ACM students at Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs.

General Notes
-------------
+ CBC MUST be handled by more than one person, at a minimum two 
  people from CBC committee need to be CC’ed on EVERY email chain 
  that is sent to hotels/Enterprise/CS Department/National Labs/etc.
    + Have the head of the CBC committee as the primary contact
+ Use the application process
+ Make sure everyone has a medium for communication at all
  times.
+ Be sure to get all instructions to the group as early as possible,
  or within a week of the event. CBC is a week-long, with one lab 
  for the first two days, a break day, followed by the other lab on 
  the following two days.  
+ For liability reasons, attendees must be 18 or older.
