How to Cyber Boot Camp
========
**Cyber Boot Camp** has been a week long cyber security training 
camp for S&T ACM students at Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs.

General Notes
-------------
+ CBC MUST be handled by more than one person, at a minimum two 
  people from CBC committee need to be CC’ed on EVERY email chain 
  that is sent to hotels/car rental company/national labs/etc. One
  person as primary contact.
+ Use the application process to your advantage. 
+ Talk with Dr.Taylor and potentially Dr.T about how to utilize 
  the application process to avoid large frustrations. 
+ Make sure everyone has at least two forms of communication at all
  times!! And charged batteries.
+ Be sure to get all instructions to the group as early as possible,
  but within a week of the event. CBC should be a week long, with 
  one lab for the first two days, a break day, followed by the other 
  lab on the next two days.  
+ Attendees must be 18 or older --for the lab safety.
