MinerLAN
========
**MinerLAN** is a LAN party/social that ACM hosts every semester on the Friday
of deadweek. The event provides time for students to destress before finals week
and get to know other students through boardgames, videogames, or other social
events.

MinerLAN Room
-------------
Reserve two rooms right next to each other. One should maximize the number of
projectors / large screens to run tournaments on. The other should be used as
the general LAN room where people can bring their systems to just play games.

Usually, ACM reserves BCH 124 to run regular tournments in and as the main LAN
room and BCH 125 for people who want to play Super Smash Bros with the S&T
Fighting Game Club.

Equipment
---------
+ **Ethernet Cables** - Make sure to bring a mix of long/short ethernet cables.
  The long ethernet cables will allow the switch to be connected to any open
  port in the room. The shorter cables will allow users to connect to that
  switch. Most users who need an ethernet cable bring one, but it is always good
  to have extra.
+ **Utensils** - Napkins, Towels, Forks, Knives, Plates, Spoons, etc.
+ **Food Supplies** - Trash bags and other necessary items for the food
  provided.
+ **Surge Protectors** - Help distribute power to everyone.
+ **Tape** - Masking tape or some other kind to tape down ethernet cables or
  other unexpected event.
+ **ACM Branding Material** - table cloth, clips, stickers, banner.
+ **Drink Cart** - bring all of the items on the drink cart, utensils, and food supplies.
+ **Camera** - Bring the camera over for the photographer.
+ **Kitchen From Home** - If you choose to cook something, you'll need bowls, 
  measuring cups, spoons, etc.
+ **Extension Cords** - If you're cooking you'll need a few extension cords for BCH.

General Tips
------------
1. Reserve both rooms and order the food to be ready 30 minutes (or any reasonable
   time) before the actual event. This will allow you to have the food on time
   and provide ample time to set up the room.
2. Get donuts around 8:45, and/or be sure there's something to eat at all times.
3. In the GAME room, set up two or three switches that maximize the efficiency
   for people to plug in. Most ethernet cables are 5-10 feet so plan accordingly
4. **Prizes** - Try to be creative with the money you have. Start planning for prize
   ideas about 3 weeks ahead of the event so that they can be ordered online if
   need be.
5. **Label everything** that ACM brings to the events. This will prevent people
   accidently taking ethernet cables and switches during cleanup.
6. Order loads of food. Trevan ordered 23 pizzas.  (12? -- not enough)
7. Have schedules put on the doors and on the board. ( and the sign in table)
8. Be sure the main game room is set up before people get there.

Tournaments
-----------
1. The number of tournaments should be limited to the number of first place
   prizes you have bought. Usually 3 is plenty, but if the any tournament 
   ends early, you could start a different one. 
2. Keep all tournaments in the separate tournament room to remove clutter and
   noise from the main gaming room. Having poker in the atrium helps!
3. Try to come up with a tournament schedule before the event and print out a
   schedule of them for the main room. This will allow people to see the
   tournament list early and be ready.
4. Announce all tournaments in the main room 15 minutes before they start to
   allow for signups with a last call 5 minutes before the tournament start
   time. It helps to write the "Set Up" time on the tournament schedule.

Future Ideas
------------
1. Allow people who brought just games or controllers to play.

    1. VR
    2. N64?
    3. Game Cube?
    4. Wii?
    5. Switch?
    6. Etc.

2. Section out some of the room into some common games so people who want to
   play can meet each other. A good way to do this would be to have tri-folds
   with the game logo on them.
3. Encourage people meeting each other and playing new games. The point behind
   MinerLAN is interacting with new people.
4. Try to stream tournaments or some other form in the main room. This will
   allow people to watch the tournaments who do not want to be directly involved
   (just an idea)
