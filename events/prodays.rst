Congratulations! You're a volunteer for this weekend's PRO Day 
event!!! YAY! Your mission is to arrive at the CS Building to get the 
banner, stickers, tees, laptop, and tablecloth (with table clips) from 
the ACM office at 11:40! Then, you will need to go check-in at Havener 
in the atrium by the helpdesk. You will then be told our table number. 
Upon receiving our table number, you will report to that table and 
begin setting up (Be ready by noon!). You will both need to be 
present throughout the event. Do not to eat during this event, as we 
can be fined and potentially asked to leave. Do not discuss specifics
about the department during the event! The event will end around 
2:30-3:00 pm. We will also be fined if there is any trash left around 
our table, so refrain from leaving anything behind.

  registration, a banner, a tablecloth, table clips, stickers, 
  and ACM t-shirts to decorate the table. 
+ **Check in** - The PRO Day people will have a table on the
  first level for check-in. Check in with them by telling them
  which student org you belong to. They will tell you where 
  you should set up. 
+ **Decorate the Table** - Put the tablecloth on the table, it
  might not fit, but don't worry. Place ACM stickers on the table
  in an organized fashion. Put a couple of ACM Tee's on the table
  at 45 degree angles near each end. Place the laptop in the 
  center of the table. Don't forget to put the banner up!
+ **Clean & Leave** - When students are no longer present, you
  should begin taking the display down. Pack everything up and
  return it to its place in the ACM office.

Sample Dialog
-------------
+ “Hi, ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery. We are the largest organization 
  for Computer Science on S&T Campus. We have multiple special interest groups in areas
  such as AI, Web Development, Security, Competition, Mentorship and Outreach, Data 
  Science, and Hack. Each special interest group usually meets once a week. We host 
  events such as the hackathon, Cyber Boot Camp, MegaMiner AI, and MinerLAN. If you’re 
  interested, please write your name and email on the sheet.“
+ Feel free to talk about any of the committees they seem interested in. Try asking the
  student what they're interested in or if they have an interest, if not, push them all!


Future Ideas
------------
1. Create a video of clips from each committee and showcase it on on the laptop. 
2. Create a physical interest form
